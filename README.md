# Cancer Prediction Flask App

This is a machine learning-powered web application built using Flask. It uses a pre-trained model to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on certain input features. The model was trained using a dataset related to breast cancer detection.

## Features
- Input user data via a form (e.g., features like concavity, compactness, and symmetry of a tumor).
- Predict whether the tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** based on the model.
- Easy-to-use interface built with Flask and HTML templates.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn (for model)
- HTML, CSS (for front-end)
- NumPy and Pickle (for model handling)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Pickle (for model loading)
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
